# ClubApp Backend

A modern backend server built with Ktor to power the ClubApp mobile application. This service provides a robust and scalable API for managing clubs, events, user sessions, and memberships.

---

## Overview

The ClubApp Backend serves as the core API layer of the ClubApp ecosystem, handling:

- Club creation, discovery, and membership management  
- Event coordination and participation tracking  
- Firebase Authentication token verification  
- Push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging  
- Role-based access control and permission enforcement  

Designed with clean architecture principles, the backend ensures clear separation of concerns, scalability, and ease of maintenance. It connects to a PostgreSQL database and uses Exposed for type-safe database access.

---

## Technology Stack

- Kotlin with Ktor  
- PostgreSQL using Exposed ORM  
- Firebase Authentication for session validation  
- Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications  
- HikariCP for connection pooling  
- kotlinx.serialization for JSON parsing

## Building & Running

To build or run the project, use one of the following tasks:

| Task                          | Description                                                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./gradlew test`              | Run the tests                                                        |
| `./gradlew build`             | Build everything                                                     |
| `buildFatJar`                 | Build an executable JAR of the server with all dependencies included |
| `buildImage`                  | Build the docker image to use with the fat JAR                       |
| `publishImageToLocalRegistry` | Publish the docker image locally                                     |
| `run`                         | Run the server                                                       |

If the server starts successfully, you'll see the following output:

```
